# MyReads Project

This is the first project of React Udacity Nanodegree. Udacity provides a static example of the CSS and HTML markup. Based in that template, it's been created a SPA with **React** using a BooksAPI. There is page to search books from the API and another page that it lists all the books selected.


## Getting Started

* 1 - [Download](https://github.com/BrunoMCerqueira/reactnd-project-myreads-starter/archive/master.zip) the repository.
* 2 - Install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* 3 - Start the development server with `npm start`


## Built With

* [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) - Environment set up
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) - Dependency Management


### Backend Server

To simplify your development process, Udacity has provided a backend server for you to develop against. The provided file **`BooksAPI.js`** contains the methods you will need to perform necessary operations on the backend:

* **`getAll`**
* **`update`**
* **`search`**

**Important**

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in SEARCH_TERMS.md. That list of terms are the only terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
